Yocto BSP Layer - For STLinux sh4 based Set-Top-Boxes
=====================================================

This is the general hardware specific BSP overlay for STLinux based devices.
It should be used with openembedded-core (not old-style org.openembedded.dev).


This layer in its entirety depends on:

    URI: http://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky
    branch: daisy
    revision: HEAD

It is preferred that people raise pull requests using GIThub by forking the appropriate tree:
